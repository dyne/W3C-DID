## üöÄ Quick start

Start by reading the documentation to understand better how Dyne.org's W3C-DID works

### [https://dyne.org/W3C-DID](https://dyne.org/W3C-DID/)

## üíæ Install

Stable releases are published on https://www.npmjs.com/package/dyne-did that have a slow pace release schedule that you can install with

```bash
yarn add @dyne/yne-did
# or if you use npm
npm install @dyne/did
```

## üéÆ Usage

The bindings are composed of four main functions:

 - **createKeyring**: takes as input a string that will be used as description inside the did document and return the string under the key **controller** along with your keyring.
 - **createRequest**: takes as input the output of the above function along with a string containg the domain and a string containg the type of request (*create*, *update* or *deactivate*) to perform and return an unsigned request that will be signed by an admin.
 - **signRequest**: takes as input a request, the signer keyring and the signer domain and return the signed request ready to be sent in order to create, update or deactivate a did document.
 - **sendRequest**: takes as input an endpoint and a request and sends the latter to `did.dyne.org/*endpoint*`.

**All input and output are in form of strings.** This means that if you want to pass a JSON you have to `JSON.stringify` it before.

There are other functions related to particular domains as well, but the functioning is almost identical.

All functions return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

To start using the Dyne.org's W3C-DID you have to create a domain admin request and send it to us. This can be created by using:

```js
import { createKeyring, createRequest } from "@dyne/did";
// or if you don't use >ES6
// const { createKeyring, createRequest } = require('@dyne/did')

// Create a new did document request
const keyring = await createKeyring("new_domain_admin_request");
const request = await createRequest(keyring, "domain_A", "create");
console.log(request);
```

Once your request has been accepted people can create a request for a special context of your domain in the following way:
```js
import { createKeyring, createRequest } from "@dyne/did";
// or if you don't use >ES6
// const { createKeyring, createRequest } = require('@dyne/did')

// Create a new did document request
const keyring = await createKeyring("new_domain_context_admin_request");
const request = await createRequest(keyring, "domain.context_A", "create");
console.log(request);
```

This request will be sent to you and you will have to sign it and you or the participant will send the result to `did.dyne.org` in order to create the new did document.

```js
import { signRequest, sendRequest } from "@dyne/did";
// or if you don't use >ES6
// const { signRequest, sendRequest } = require('@dyne/did')

//Sign did document request, the inputs can be modified
const signedRequest = await signRequest(request, keyring, "domain_A");
const result = await sendRequest("api/v1/domain/pubkeys-accept.chain", signedRequest);
```
